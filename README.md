### bring your meteor mantra development up to speed

Please make sure you read [Mantra Specification](https://kadirahq.github.io/mantra/) and visit the [official repository](https://github.com/kadirahq/mantra). Keep in mind that Mantra is an approach to application architecture rather than a framework. It is supposed to keep our options open and not lock us in to any particular library, we are free to choose how manage routing, state management and data-binding. In other words bring your own toolkit: flow router / react router GraphQL, Redux or any other shiny new thing.

### Setting Up

* make sure you have Meteor installed

* make sure you are on mantra-modules-experiment-02 branch

```
npm install
meteor --port 5005
```
Your app should be running [http://localhost:5005](http://localhost:5005)

### Roadmap

This is an early draft. Mantra architecture is very fresh and React environment is quite dynamic, that means things will change and break. We will be following the discussions and will try to keep this project up to date.

The goal is to bring some simple yet valuable to most apps features:

* user management
* role management
* ACL management
* profile page
* account page
* advanced CRUD component with pagination
* file manager

### Running Tests (to be completed)

In this app, every part of the client side is fully tested using the familiar tools like Mocha, Chai and Sinon.

Run tests with:

```
npm test
```

**See package.json for more information about testing setup.**
